        <h1>Collab Manager Project</h1>
        <p>
          This project is a full stack web application deployed to administer
          collab hours in CSCI0320: Introduction to Software Engineering at
          Brown.
        </p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          I developed this project on a team of 4 for my final project as a
          student in CSCI0320. Our idea came from the lack of organization of
          collab hours in the course, where students in the course serve as one
          anothers' TAs. Prior to our system, the real TAs used google forms to
          pair students serving as TAs and students needing help. We realized we
          could streamline this process in one full stack application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We built the backend in Java and the frontend with React and
          TypeScript. In particular, I focused on building the backend and
          ensuring that it was thread safe and could handle requests from many
          students at once. I did so through two queues, one from students
          serving as TAs and one for students needing help, and continuously
          popped and paired from the queues.
        </p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
          Two semesters after developing this application as my final project in
          CSCI0320, I became a TA for the course. I pitched the idea of using my
          application in practice, and the head TAs agreed. This gave me the
          unique opportunity to deploy the frontend and backend and test the
          application with real users.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I deployed the system for the course, it experienced a variety
          of concurrency and storage issues, which I resolved throughout the
          semester. The application is still currently live and available to
          CSCI0320 students below.
