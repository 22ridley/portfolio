        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          I worked on this project on a team of 4 for my final project as a
          student in <b>CSCI0320</b>. We chose this project after noticing the
          lack of organization of collab hours in the course, where students
          serve as one anothers' teaching assistants (TAs).
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of the application is to seamlessly pair and manage students
          during collab hours. We built the <b>backend in Java</b> and the
          <b>frontend with TypeScript and React</b>. In particular, I focused on
          building the <b>backend</b> and ensuring that it was thread safe and
          could handle requests from many students at once. Despite my
          backend-heavy work, I also created the sketches for the frontend.
          Throughout the design process, we prioritized
          <b>accessible</b> features, including aria labels and color schemes
          that are inclusive of low-vision users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="prob">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The core problem was <b>poor organization</b>. Prior to our system,
          <b>instructors</b> used Google forms to pair
          <b>help requesters</b> and <b>debugging partners</b>. Also, there are
          many resources used in collaboration hours, but the tools are
          scattered across various locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We realized we could streamline this process in one full stack
          application to make collab hours more <b>productive, organized</b> and
          <b>standardized</b>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="key">Key Terms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>COLLAB HOURS</b>: Similar to office hours, but students (help
            requesters) fix bugs and conceptual issues with the help of other
            students in the class (debugging partners)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>DEBUGGING PARTNER</b>: Student scheduled to help others debug
            their code
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>HELP REQUESTER</b>: Student attending collab hours because they
            need help
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>INSTRUCTOR</b>: Teaching assistant or professor running collab
            hours
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="user">User Research</h3>
        <p>
          The first step of our project was to conduct user research to
          understand how to design our application to best address all of our
          stakeholders' needs. Our stakeholders include the students and the
          instructors of the course. Here are the questions we asked our
          stakeholders:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the most important parts of collab section?</li>
          <li>
            What currently works and could be improved about collab section?
          </li>
          <li>
            As a <b>*insert stakeholder*</b>, what features are non-negotiable
            in an application to facilitate collab hours?
          </li>
          <li>
            As a <b>*insert stakeholder*</b>, what features would be nice but
            not necessary in an application to facilitate collab hours?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Below are summaries of the responses we received from our
          stakeholders:
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary>Students</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Collab hours are useful skill for students to learn to help each
              other.
            </li>
            <li>
              At collab hours, TAs are often busy with logistics, leading to
              longer wait times for escalation when the debugging partner can't
              help.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collab hours are currently not effective for conceptual questions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Teaching Assistants</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The pairing process could be improved, since some students debug
              multiple times while others don't.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently, all TA duties (attendance, pairing, escalation) are
              tracked on different platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some students try to escalate and get TA help before the 15 minute
              period is over.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Professor</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The learning goal of collab hours isnot achieved if not all
              students are able to serve as a debugging partner.
            </li>
            <li>The structure of collab hours is likely changing in future.</li>
            <li>
              Despite its flaws, collab hours successful because disrupts the
              traditional format of CS hours (lots of bugs fixed and shorter
              lines).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <h3 id="feat">Features</h3>
        <p>
          After our user research, we had a more clear vision of what our
          stakeholders needed out of our application for managing collab hours.
          Here are the main features we needed to prioritize:
        </p>
        <div class="feature-grid">
          <div class="grid-item">

          <div class="grid-item">
            <h4>Escalating</h4>
            <p>
              Available on the debugging partner dashboard after 15 minutes on
              the timer, and the instructor dashboard will have a list of who is
              escalated
            </p>

          <div class="grid-item">

          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

            <p>
              Separate views for instructors, help requesters, and debugging
              partners, all prioritizing <b>accessibility</b>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h4>Debugging Form</h4>

              The form will be embedded on the website instead of a separate
              google form, and answers will be saved to CSV on the backend
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h4>Attendance</h4>

          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
        <p>
          After deciding on our principal features together, I took on the task
          of creating sketches for the user interfaces. My goal in this design
          was to create dashboards that are <b>simple</b> and <b>accessible</b>.
          For accessibility, I focused on high color contrast and intuitive
          focus order. Creating these sketches also helped me imagine how the
          application would flow between these pages.
        </p>
        <div class="sketches-grid">
          <div>
            <p><b>Login Page</b></p>

        <h3 id="web">Website</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, the largest part of this project was building the frontend
          and backend of the website. As mentioned, I focused on building the
          backend in <b>Java</b>, and my teammates worked on developing the
          frontend in <b>React</b> and <b>Typescript</b>. We started by mocking
          the frontend and backend, and worked through an iterative process over
          4 weeks, sharing our designs and feedback with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the main backend designer, I had the opportunity to design an
          <b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b> system for pairing students. My
          main concerns were that no students were dropped and did not receive
          the help they needed, and that debugging partners could not cheat the
          system and receive credit without showing up. To address the first, I
          built two queues that continuously pop and pair debugging partners and
          help requesters. I also built a feature to track attendance, and give
          instructors the power to remove absent students from the record. Below
          is the final website:

        <h3 id="ref">Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          Two semesters after developing this application as my final project in
          CSCI0320, I became a TA for the course. I pitched the idea of using
          this application in practice to run collab hours, and the head TAs
          agreed. This gave me the unique opportunity to
          <b>deploy the frontend and backend</b> and test the application with
          <b>real student users</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          After I deployed the system for the course, it experienced a variety
          of concurrency and storage issues, which I resolved throughout the
          semester. Although this was difficult, I felt
          <b>so much pride to be using my application with real users</b> and
          learned a lot. In this process, I also saw that importance of
          protecting user privacy up close, given that debugging the backend, I
          could see complete logs of user interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I could do this project again, I would have brought up concerns of
          user privacy earlier in the development process, and explicitly
          collected consent for the student information we tracked and stored.
          As students, there is a reasonable expectation that instructors will
          collect data about participation in course activites, yet it is still
          important that they are informed of this collection. Overall, this
          project was a great opportunity to learn how to conduct user research,
          iteratively build a full stack application, and resolve bugs once it
          was deployed.
