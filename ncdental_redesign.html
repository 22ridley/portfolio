        <p>
          'Responsive' websites use HTML and CSS to automatically resize or
          rearrange their content as the screen's dimensions change. Many
          high-profile websites prioritize <b>responsiveness</b>, however, many
          others with less resources for development and maintenance do not
          react to screen dimensions. I will take one such website, the homepage
          for the
          <a
            href="https://www.ncdentalboard.org/index.htm"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            >North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners (NCSBDE)</a
          >, and redesign its homepage for responsiveness.
        </p>
        <h3 id="id">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          I chose the NCSBDE website because it provides important information
          that pertains to many North Carolina citizens, however, the site's
          usability is impeded by its lack of <b>responsive</b> design. By
          identifying flaws with its design and iteratively building a more
          responsive version, I will practice holding responsiveness at the
          center of the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The screenshots below display the current
          <a
            href="https://www.ncdentalboard.org/index.htm"

            class="link"
            >NCSBDE website</a
          >
          at various screen widths (375x667px, 768x1024px, and 3840x2160px).
          These screen widths represent the view on mobile, tablet, and computer
          respectively. As shown, the website does not consistently resize or
          rearrange its content depending on screen size, and instead, content
          often gets cut off on mobile. And, on the computer, the screen has an
          awkward amount of padding on the left and right.

        <p>
          After exploring the NCSBDE homepage, I compiled this table of the
          <a
            class="link"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/"
            >usability</a
          >
          (learnability, memorability, and efficiency) and accessibility issues
          I identified with the website. To detect accessibility issues, I used
          the tool
          <a class="link" href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank"
            >WebAIM WAVE</a
          >, which automatically detects possible accessibility problems.

            <div class="grid-item-w-icon">
              <h4>Learnability</h4>
              <img
                src="public/ncdental/thumbs_down.svg"
                alt="Thumbs down icon"
                width="6%"
              />
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since learnability refers to the ability of new users to
                accomplish tasks, one learnability problem is the presence of
                many external deadlinks on the page. For example, the pages
                tries to link to the NC Secretary of State website,
                <a href="www.secstate.state.nc.us" target="_blank" class="link"
                  >www.secstate.state.nc.us</a
                >, but this is a deadlink, which is confusing for new and old
                users.
              </li>
              <li>
                The NCSBDE homepage also links to other pages within the NCSBDE
                site in confusing and disjointed ways, since there is a header
                in purple of pages to navigate to, another row in red of pages
                below that, as well as a column along the left side of other
                pages. This disjoint makes it diffult for new users to find the
                page they need.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="grid-item-w-icon">
              <h4>Memorability</h4>
              <img
                src="public/ncdental/thumbs_down.svg"
                alt="Thumbs down icon"
                width="6%"
              />
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The sheer number of navigable pages from the homepage makes it
                difficult to remember where a page you have been to before is.
                Also, several of these links are very similar and could be
                consolidated for efficiency, like 'Anesthesia/Sedation Permits'
                and 'License & Permits'.
              </li>
              <li>
                Another memorability problem with the NCSBDE website is the lack
                of coordination of colors. The top header nav bar is purple,
                while the nav bar below that is red, and the nav bar column
                along the left has no background color. Colors can be a valuable
                memory trigger, so a lack of standardization further impedes
                returning users' abilities to navigate the page.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

              <h4>Efficiency</h4>
              <img
                src="public/ncdental/thumbs_down.svg"
                alt="Thumbs down icon"

              />
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the user clicks 'Verification/Disciplinary History' on the
                left column, several other links in the left column disappear,
                including `Anesthesia/ Sedation Permits'. This inconsistency in
                the left column nav bar happens on several pages. This impedes
                efficiency because users have to return to the homepage in
                between.
              </li>
              <li>
                The height of this homepage also impedes efficiency because this
                homepage has 25 long subsections. There is no table of contents
                nor hyperlinks to these subsubsections, so even experienced
                users who know where they need to go still have to spend a lot
                of time scrolling to get there.

            </div>
            <p>WebAIM Wave discovered many accessibility issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                'No heading structure': The page has no headings, instead, all
                the text is within a div, span, or p, and manually styled. This
                makes it more difficult for screen readers to report the
                structure of this page to users.
              </li>
              <li>
                'Null or empty alternative text': None of the images on this
                page have alternative text. This means that Screen Readers
                cannot report their contents to visually impaired users.
              </li>
              <li>
                'Very low contrast between text and background colors': The
                section 'Functions of the Board' has green text and green
                background with very close shades, increasing difficulties for
                visually-impaired users.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          As described, the NCSBDE website suffers from a variety of
          <b>learnability, memorability, efficiency,</b> and
          <b>accessibility</b> issues. The common themes are the confusing
          nature of the 3 separate nav components, the lack of color
          coordination, the long height of the page and lack of structure, and
          the lack of responsiveness to narrow screens. Addressing each problem
          would improve the user experience and ease of use, not just for those
          with accessibility issues or new users, but for all users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="vis">Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
        <p>
          After identifying these usability and accessibility issues, I
          redesigned the homepage of the NCSBDE website with these concerns in
          mind. Before recreating the website with HTML and CSS, I created a
          <b>visual design style guide</b> and mockups with the design tool
          Figma.

          contains the main colors, typography, and reusable components for my
          mockups and redesigned webpage. Creating a consistent palette and
          matching components improved the <b>coordination</b> and
          <b>cohesion</b>
          of my final redesign, and ideally improves the user experience.

          My redesigns attempt to address the usability and accessibility issues
          I identified earlier in the following ways.

        <div class="two-two-grid">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <div class="grid-item-w-icon">
              <h4>Learnability</h4>
              <img
                src="public/ncdental/thumbs_up.svg"
                alt="Thumbs up icon"
                width="6%"
              />
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                My redesign addresses learnability by consolidating the links to
                other NCSBDE pages. On computer, these internal links are all
                within the header and the dropdowns from the header. On mobile
                and tablet, these internal links are within the hamburger popup.
              </li>
              <li>
                Consolidating these links from 3 locations into only 1 component
                makes the homepage more learnable because it centralizes
                navigation and simplifies the experience for first-time users.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">

            <ul>
              <li>
                I addressed memorability by coordinating the color palette and
                reducing the number of internal links in the header/hamburger
                popup. First, I made the header, as well as all subsections of
                the homepage, the color 'grape' to unify the navigational
                components of the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                By reducing the color palette to only a few coordinated accent
                colors, the page is more cohesive and its elements are more
                memorable to returning users. Also, reducing the number of
                internal links makes it faster for returning users to find which
                page they need to revisit.

            <ul>
              <li>
                My redesign addresses efficiency by reducing the length of the
                homepage. Instead of including all 25 subsections, I kept only
                the five most recently-added subsections, and then added an
                'Archive' section which would link to old subsections.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also created a table of contents to scroll to each subsection,
                which improves efficiency by allowing experienced users to
                navigate to the section they need more quickly (instead of
                scrolling manually).

                I addressed accessibility primarily by making the homepage
                responsive, which allows users to access all functionalities of
                the homepage regardless of screen size.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also added alt text to all images, using headers to create
                structure, and carefully chose font colors and background colors
                to prioritize contrast and readability. Each of these choices
                removes barriers from people with physical and visual
                impairments to interact with the homepage.

        <p>
          This redesign was a valuable exercise in critiquing the
          <b>usability, accessibility,</b> and <b>responsiveness</b> of an
          existing website, and then putting my observations into practice. I
          also found it valuable to understand the tradeoffs necessary when
          building a website, and how to justify these choices through several
          iterations.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found it suprising how many important websites like the NCSBDE
          homepage lack responsive features, impeding the user experience and
          making actions more difficult. However, it is easy to see a website
          and grumble about how unresponsive and awkward its interface is. In
          reality, I learned that building a responsive website is not at all
          simple, and takes careful thought, planning, and iteration.
