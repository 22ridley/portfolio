        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this case study, I examined one UI component and considered an
          alternative design that could increase the component's
          <b>accesibility</b>, potentially at the risk of learnability,
          memorability, or efficiency. The UI component I chose is the
          <b>dropdown menu</b>. I explored the accessibility of this component
          across devices and across modes of interacting with the device.
        </p>
        <h3 id="prob">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Many applications use default dropdown components, and many others
          have custom dropdowns. Regardless of who designed it, many dropdown
          components suffer from a lack of <b>usability</b> and
          <b>accessibility</b>, as I will explore. By understanding flaws with
          dropdown components in use in popular applications, I can practice
          designing with an alternative approach that prioritizes
          <b>accessibility</b>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="input">Input</h3>
        <p>
          I began by examining three applications with dropdown menus, including
          the EdStem website, the Appple Calendar web/mobile app, and the
          Starbucks website/mobile app. For context, EdStem is a message board
          platform that facilitates student, TA, and professor interactions in
          use at Brown University. I first explored how different modes of
          <b>input</b>, including the mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touch (on
          mobile) enabled different interactions with a dropdown menus in these
          three applications.
        </p>
        <p><b>EdStem Web App</b></p>
        <img
          src="public/acc/edstem-screenshots.svg"
          alt="Compiled screenshots of my interactions with the filter dropdown menu on EdStem"
          class="img-pad"
          width="75%"
        />
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover over "Filter", the button turns from gray to blue.
                Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu appears below the
                "Filter" button.
              </li>
              <li>
                One feature that stood was that the button turns blue on hover,
                whereas neither Apple Calendar or Starbucks components change
                color on hover. This makes it easier for a mouse user to see
                that they are in range to click the dropdown menu button they
                want to press.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I had to press the tab key until "Filter" was focused, then I
                used the return key to open the menu. Then, I could use the up
                and down arrows to change which option was focused. When I
                pressed return, the focused option was inputted.
              </li>
              <li>
                With my keyboard, I can't select the text in the dropdown menu.
                I tried Command + A, but it selected all the other text on the
                page except the text in the dropdown menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom of my
                screen, and covers the entire screen. From there, I can click on
                a filter, which closes the dropdown and applies the filter, or
                click "Cancel", which closes the dropdown without filtering.
              </li>
              <li>
                If there are too many filter options to fit the screen height, I
                can scroll to see more options below.
              </li>
            </ul>

          alt="Compiled screenshots of my interactions with the calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
          class="img-pad"
          width="85%"
        />
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover with my mouse over the dropdown button, it does not
                change. Once I click the button, the menu appears over the
                button.
              </li>
              <li>
                One gap in learnability is that the dropdown menu has an up and
                a down arrow on the button, while many users would expect only a
                down arrow. There is no text on this button, which not learnable
                but is efficient from a space perspective.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With a calendar event open, as I tabbed through the options on
                the editing window, the dropdown menu button was never focused.
              </li>
              <li>
                This component not being navigable with the keyboard makes it
                unusable and inaccessible. This is a mismatch, since the
                dropdown can only be used with a mouse or VoiceOver.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu pulls up and covers the right
                half of my screen. I can scroll when the options overflow, click
                to the left to leave the dropdown, or select a calendar option.
              </li>
              <li>
                This dropdown is more learnable than on desktop because the name
                of the current calendar is on the mobile dropdown menu button.
              </li>
            </ul>

          width="85%"
        />
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover with my mouse over the dropdown button, it does not
                change. When I click it, it turns green and the dropdown menu
                opens over it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Something that could improve efficiency would be adding a
                "Favorites" section at the top of the dropdown where users could
                save their preferred milk for easy clicking, since repeat
                customers often have strong milk preferences.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With my keyboard, I used the tab key to focus on the dropdown
                button, but when I pressed the return key, the menu did not
                open. I later learned that only with VoiceOver on, I could use
                the keys Control + Option + Space to open the menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar to Apple Calendar, I was disappointed that I failed to
                navigate into the milk dropdown with my keyboard.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom and
                covers almost the entire screen. I can scroll when the options
                overflow, click to the X to leave the dropdown, or select a milk
                option.
              </li>
              <li>
                I appreciate that the Starbucks website and mobile app have
                similar dropdown designs. This makes the platforms more
                efficient and learnable for users who switch between the website
                and app.
              </li>

        </div>
        <h3 id="output">Output</h3>
        <p>
          After exploring inputs, I also explored <b>outputs</b> from the
          dropdown menus on these three applications. The inputs can change the
          state of a dropdown component, and the output reflects these state
          changes to the user. I explored outputs including <b>color</b>,
          <b>text label</b>, <b>focus order</b>, and
          <b>screen reader output</b>.

        <h3 id="state">State Models</h3>
        <p>
          After exploring input and output from dropdowns on EdStem, Apple
          Calendar, and Starbucks, I had several ideas about how to improve the
          dropdown components found in all three applications. However, this
          case study will focus on my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in
          Apple Calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before beginning my redesign, I created <b>state models</b> to display
          the current interactions with Apple Calendar's calendar dropdown menu.
          State models show both the available states of the component, as well
          as the actions that transition between states. Below, the two state
          models display pre-revision interactions with the touchpad and the
          keyboard respectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</b></p>
        <div class="image-box">
          <img
            src="public/acc/initial-calendar-model-mouse.svg"
            alt="State model for pre-revision mouse interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
            width="60%"
          />
          <div class="left-pad">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Given that this is the state model for mouse interactions, the
                user's mouse position and clicks cause all transitions between
                states. Another important note is that "Open" means that the
                dropdown menu has appeared.
              </li>
              <li>
                As shown in the state model, the dropdown menu stays visible
                even when the mouse leaves the area, but disappears if the mouse
                clicks outside of the dropdown menu area.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p><b>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Keyboard User</b></p>
        <div class="image-box">
          <div class="right-pad">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Without VoiceOver, I was unable to focus on the dropdown menu
                button with only my keyboard on Mac. So, this state model is
                missing a transition from inactive to focused, although it
                should be noted that the button can be tabbed into focus when
                VoiceOver is active.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the calendar dropdown menu button is focused, then users
                can press the return key, up and down arrows, and escape key to
                transition between states, as shown.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <img

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          As noted above, there are several areas of improvement for these state
          models. Below, I present two new state models for my revised calendar
          dropdown, with mouse and with keyboard. The main design change I made
          includes adding a "Confirm" button to the dropdown menu. I will
          explore and justify this choice alongside the Figma models further
          below.
        </p>

        <p><b>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</b></p>
        <div class="image-box">

            alt="State model for revised keyboard interactions with calendar dropdown menu on Apple Calendar"
            width="65%"
          />
          <div class="left-pad">
            <ul>
              <li>
                The main revision I made was introducing a "Confirm" button on
                the dropdown menu. Now, after a user clicks one of the dropdown
                options, they also need to click "Confirm" to actually select
                their chosen option and close the dropdown.
              </li>
              <li>
                If they do not select "Confirm" after clicking an option, and
                instead click away, their selection will not be submitted.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br />
        <p><b>Revised Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Keyboard User </b></p>
        <div class="image-box">
          <div class="right-pad">
            <ul>
              <li>
                For keyboard interaction, I added a transition from disabled to
                focused with the tab key, which the initial state model lacked.
              </li>
              <li>
                This revised keyboard model also adds a "Confirm" button. Once
                the user has focused on an option, when they press return, their
                focused option is selected. This also automatically focuses on
                "Confirm", and the user can press the return key again to
                submit.
              </li>

          >
          is my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in Apple Calendar, which
          allows users to assign an event to a particular calendar. In the model
          above, this dropdown is opened with the button with the blue square
          and the up/down arrows, located in the event editing window. The model
          contains three frames, described below:
        </p>
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Initial State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first Figma frame displays the initial state of my revised
                calendar dropdown menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is the state before the user has interacted with the
                dropdown, so the dropdown button is visible but the dropdown
                menu window has not been opened.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Open, Option Highlighted State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the user opens the dropdown menu and hovers over (or
                focuses on) an option, they will see the second frame.
              </li>
              <li>
                Here, the dropdown menu is open and one of the options is
                highlighted. However, the user has not clicked on their
                selection yet.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Open, Option Selected State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This is a bonus state that is important to understanding my
                redesign. After the user clicks on (or presses return on) an
                option, that option turns dark gray, but is not yet submitted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Instead, the user still must press "Confirm" to submit their
                selection and close the dropdown.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          While not shown in the Figma models, one way that my redesign
          increases <b>accessibility</b> is by allowing users to focus on the
          dropdown with their keyboard but without VoiceOver. This interaction
          was surprisingly missing in Apple Calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only way that this change decreases <b>efficiency</b> is by adding
          one more component that keyboard users need to tab through as they
          explore the event editing window. However, this is an insignficant
          loss in efficiency that significantly increases accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in other ways, my revised component does increase
          <b>accessibility</b> at the expense of efficiency. Adding a "Confirm"
          button means that frequent users have one more click or key to press
          before they can submit their dropdown selection. But, this increases
          accessibility beacuse it means that users with impaired motor control
          are less likely to accidentally submit their selection. The extra
          confirmation transition allows users to accidentally select an option,
          but change their selection without the window closing.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ref">Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          This case study was a valuable opportunity to intentionally design a
          component with <b>accessibility</b> as the main priority. When
          thinking about making components more accessible, it's useful to think
          in terms of <b>mismatches</b>, or situations where an interface
          creates unnecessary barriers for certain users due to a lack of
          inclusive thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my redesign, adding keyboard navigability addresses the mismatch
          where users that only use the keyboard can still interact with this
          component. Similarly, adding "Confirm" addresses the mismatch where
          some users may accidentally press or interact with these components,
          and the confirmation step accomodates accidental clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, the mouse is most often prioritized when designing
          components, as many designers are fully-abled. But, this means that
          they may forget to consider the needs of those whose abilities are
          impaired. So, in this case study, I learned to prioritize the needs of
          users with abilities different from mine, while considering carefully
          tradeoffs with <b>usability</b>.
