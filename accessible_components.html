        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In this case study, I examined one UI component and considered an
          alternative design that could increase the component's accesibility,
          potentially at the risk of learnability, memorability, or efficiency.
          The UI component I chose is the dropdown menu. I explored the
          accessibility of this component across devices and across modes of
          interacting with the device.
        </p>
        <h3 id="input">Input</h3>
        <p>
          I began by examining three applications with dropdown menus, including
          the EdStem website, the Appple Calendar web/mobile app, and the
          Starbucks website/mobile app. For context, EdStem is a message board
          platform that facilitates student, TA, and professor interactions in
          use at Brown University. I first explored how different modes of
          input, including the mouse/touchpad, keyboard, and touch (on mobile)
          enabled different interactions with a dropdown menus in these three
          applications.
        </p>
        <p><b>EdStem Web App</b></p>

          alt="Compiled screenshots of my interactions with the filter dropdown menu on EdStem"
          class="img-pad"
          width="75%"
        />
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover over "Filter", the button turns from gray to blue.
                Once I click on the button, the dropdown menu appears below the
                "Filter" button. If I move my mouse away, the dropdown menu
                stays visible, but when I click anywhere other than the dropdown
                menu, it disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                One feature that stood was that the button turns blue on hover,
                whereas neither Apple Calendar or Starbucks components change
                color on hover. This makes it easier for a mouse user to see
                that they are in range to click the dropdown menu button they
                want to press.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To use the dropdown with the keyboard only, I had to press the
                tab key until "Filter" was focused. Once focused, I used the
                return key to open the menu. Then, I could use the up and down
                arrows to change which option was focused. When I pressed
                return, the focused option was inputted.
              </li>
              <li>
                With my keyboard, I found that I can't select the text in the
                dropdown menu. I tried Command + A, but it selected all the
                other text on the page except the text in the dropdown menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom of my
                screen, and covers the entire screen. From there, I can click on
                a filter, which closes the dropdown and applies the filter, or
                click "Cancel", which closes the dropdown without filtering.
              </li>
              <li>
                As with the mouse and keyboard, I cannot highlight the text in
                the dropdown on my phone. However, one functionality this
                component does have is scrolling. If there are too many filter
                options to fit the screen height, I can scroll to see more
                options below.
              </li>

        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover with my mouse over the dropdown button, it does not
                change. Once I click the button, the menu appears over the
                button. If I move my mouse on the screen, the dropdown menu
                stays visible, but when I click anywhere other than the menu, it
                disappears.
              </li>
              <li>
                One gap in learnability is that the dropdown menu has an up and
                a down arrow on the button, while many users would expect only a
                down arrow. There is no text on this button, which not learnable
                but is efficient from a space perspective.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using only the keyboard to navigate this dropdown menu on Apple
                Calendar was virtually impossible. With a calendar event open,
                as I tabbed through the options on the editing window, the
                dropdown menu button was never focused.
              </li>
              <li>
                This component not being navigable with the keyboard makes it
                unusable and inaccessible. This is a mismatch, since the
                dropdown can only be used with a mouse or VoiceOver. Those who
                rely on their keyboard due to physical impairments therefore
                likely struggle to toggle an event's assigned calendar.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu pulls up and covers the right
                half of my screen. I can scroll when the options overflow, click
                to the left to leave the dropdown, or select a calendar option.
              </li>
              <li>
                This dropdown is more learnable than on desktop because the name
                of the current calendar is on the mobile dropdown menu button.
                This is more learnable and memorable because the text helps new
                users to more quickly understand that the dropdown will let them
                select a different calendar for this event.

        <div class="col-box">

            <p><b>Mouse/Touchpad</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I hover with my mouse over the dropdown button, it does not
                change. When I click it, it turns green and the dropdown menu
                opens over it. If I move my mouse on the screen, the menu stays
                visible, but when I click anywhere other than the dropdown menu,
                it closes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Something that could improve efficiency would be adding a
                "Favorites" section at the top of the dropdown where users could
                save their preferred milk for easy clicking, since repeat
                customers often have strong milk preferences.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Keyboard</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                With my keyboard, I used the tab key to focus on the dropdown
                button, but when I pressed the return key, the menu did not
                open. I later learned that with VoiceOver on, I could use the
                keys Control + Option + Space to open the menu. However, this
                combination does not work when VoiceOver is off.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similar to Apple Calendar, I was disappointed that I failed to
                navigate into the milk dropdown with my keyboard. Again, this
                impedes the learnability, memorability, and efficiency of this
                feature.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Touch/Mobile</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                On my phone, the dropdown menu comes up from the bottom and
                covers almost the entire screen. I can scroll when the options
                overflow, click to the X to leave the dropdown, or select a milk
                option.
              </li>
              <li>
                I appreciate that the Starbucks website and mobile app have
                similar dropdown designs. This makes the platforms more
                efficient for users who switch between the website and the
                mobile app. This also makes both more learnable for those who
                have already used the other.

        <h3 id="output">Output</h3>
        <p>
          After exploring inputs, I also explored outputs from the dropdown
          menus on these three applications. The inputs can change the state of
          a dropdown component, and the output reflects these state changes to
          the user. I explored outputs including colors, text label, focus
          order, and screen reader output.

                The "Filter" dropdown button turns blue on hover, which signals
                that this "Filter" text is clickable. Once the dropdown menu is
                open, when hovering over an option, it turns blue, signalling
                that it can be selected.

              <td>
                Each calendar is assigned a color, and the button's color
                changes to the color of the calendar selected. This color output
                increases efficiency, because users learn what color calendar
                they are looking for without needing to read the text in the
                dropdown menu.
              </td>
              <td>
                Hovering over the "Milk" dropdown button on the Starbucks
                website on Mac, its color does not change. I don't find this
                color output useful, since when you click the button, the
                dropdown menu also appears, so you already know you've clicked
                the button.
              </td>

            <tr>
              <th><b>Text Label</b></th>
              <td>
                The button to open this dropdown menu is initially labeled with
                the text "Filter" and a downward arrow. However, after the user
                selects a filter from the dropdown, the text label changes from
                "Filter" to the name of the filter applied, such as "Unread", as
                in my screenshots.
              </td>
              <td>
                On Mac, there is no text label on the calendar dropdown button,
                only the color of the calendar and the up and down arrows. On
                mobile, the button does have text, and it is the calendar
                currently selected for the event. This text output verifies to
                users that they selected the correct calendar.
              </td>
              <td>
                The dropdown button is labeled above it with “Milk”, to signal
                that this dropdown selects a milk option, and the name of the
                current milk. The default is 2% milk, but if the user selects a
                different milk, the text label updates. Instead of a default, it
                should start as “Not Selected”, and the user shouldn't be able
                to buy the drink without selecting a milk.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><b>Focus Order</b></th>
              <td>
                Using the tab key, I can focus on the "Filter" dropdown button,
                and then use the return key to open the menu. Then, I have to
                use the up and down keys to switch between options, and the tab
                key does nothing. In addition to the up and down keys, I think
                the tab key should also work to switch between these options.
              </td>
              <td>
                When I use the tab key inside this window, the dropdown menu is
                never focused on. This sends confusing outputs/signals back to
                the user. If they cannot focus on the dropdown menu, the
                application is signalling that it is disabled or not clickable,
                even though it is (and holds important functionality).
              </td>
              <td>
                In the input section above, I found that I could focus on
                Starbucks' dropdown using the tab key, but could not use the
                keyboard to open the dropdown menu. Since the return key does
                nothing, the user might be confused and think that they have
                focused on the wrong component in their effort to customize
                their milk selection.
              </td>

              <td>
                On my Mac, I turned on VoiceOver and focused on the "Filter"
                dropdown button. VoiceOver reads out "Filter, menu pop up
                collapsed, button". When I opened the dropdown menu, VoiceOver
                read out "menu, ..." followed by each of the dropdown options.
              </td>
              <td>
                When I turned VoiceOver on, I was able to use the tab key to
                focus on the calendar dropdown button. I turned VoiceOver off
                again and confirmed that I couldn't without it. This impedes
                acccessibility, because not all impaired users use VoiceOver, or
                a screen reader at all.
              </td>
              <td>
                VoiceOver instructed me to press Control + Option + Space to
                open the dropdown. I tried this keystroke again with VoiceOver
                off, which did not work. Like Apple Calendar, Starbucks has
                created an accessibility problem by mismatching the needs of
                those that do not use VoiceOver.

        <p>
          After exploring input and output from dropdowns on EdStem, Apple
          Calendar, and Starbucks, I had several ideas about how to improve the
          dropdown components found in all three applications. However, this
          case study will focus on my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in
          Apple Calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before beginning my redesign, I created state models to display the
          current interactions with Apple Calendar's calendar dropdown menu.
          State models show both the available states of the component, as well
          as the actions that transition between states. Below, the two state
          models display pre-revision interactions with the touchpad and the
          keyboard respectively. Note that I often refer to pink highlights or
          borders, which is a Mac system setting that users customize, so these
          components are not pink for all users.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><b>Initial Calendar Dropdown Menu Component: Mouse User</b></p>
        <div class="image-box">

            width="60%"
          />
          <p class="left-pad">
            Given that this is the state model for mouse interactions, the
            user's mouse position and clicks cause all transitions between
            states. Another important note is that "Open" means that the
            dropdown menu has appeared. As shown in the state model, the
            dropdown menu stays visible even when the mouse leaves the area, but
            disappears if the mouse clicks outside of the dropdown menu area.
          </p>

            <p>
              As described in the input and output sections, without VoiceOver,
              I was unable to focus on the dropdown menu button with only my
              keyboard on Mac. So, this state model is missing a transition from
              inactive to focused, although it should be noted that the button
              can be tabbed into focus when VoiceOver is active.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the calendar dropdown menu button is focused, then users can
              press the return key, up and down arrows, and escape key to
              transition between states, as shown.
            </p>

          />
        </div>
        <p>
          As noted above, there are several areas of improvement for these state
          models. Below, I present two new state models for my revised calendar
          dropdown, with mouse and with keyboard. The main design change I made
          includes adding a "Confirm" button to the dropdown menu. I will
          explore and justify this choice alongside the Figma models further
          below.
        </p>

            width="65%"
          />
          <p class="left-pad">
            As mentioned, the main revision I made was introducing a "Confirm"
            button on the dropdown menu. Now, after a user clicks one of the
            dropdown options, they also need to click the "Confirm" button to
            actually select their chosen option and close the dropdown menu. If
            they do not select "Confirm" after clicking an option, and instead
            click away, their selection will not be submitted.
          </p>

          <div class="right-pad">
            <p>
              For keyboard interaction, I added a transition from disabled to
              focused with the tab key, which the initial state model lacked.
            </p>
            <p>
              As in the revised mouse model, this revised keyboard model also
              introduces a "Confirm" button. Once the user has focused on an
              option with the up and down keys, when they press return, their
              focused option is selected. This also automatically focuses the
              "Confirm" button. So, the user needs to press the return key again
              to activate the "Confirm" button and submit their selection.

          is my redesign of the calendar dropdown menu in Apple Calendar, which
          allows users to assign an event to a particular calendar. In the model
          above, this dropdown is opened with the button with the blue square
          and the up/down arrows, located in the event editing window. The model
          contains three frames, described below:
        </p>
        <div class="col-box">
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Initial State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The first Figma frame displays the initial state of my revised
                calendar dropdown menu. This is the state before the user has
                interacted with the dropdown, so the dropdown button is visible
                but the dropdown menu window has not been opened.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Open, Option Highlighted State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the user opens the dropdown menu and hovers over (or
                focuses on) an option, they will see the second frame. Here, the
                dropdown menu is open and one of the options is highlighted.
                However, the user has not clicked on (or pressed the return key
                while focusing on) their selection yet.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-box-item">
            <p><b>Open, Option Selected State</b></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This is a bonus state that is important to understanding my
                redesign. After the user clicks on (or presses return on) an
                option, that option turns dark gray, but is not yet submitted.
                Instead, the user still must press the "Confirm" button to
                submit their selection and close the dropdown menu.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          While not shown in the Figma models, the first way that my redesign
          increases accessibility is by allowing users to focus on the dropdown
          with their keyboard but without VoiceOver. This interaction was
          surprisingly missing in Apple Calendar. The only way that this change
          decreases efficiency is by adding one more component that keyboard
          users need to tab through as they explore the event editing window.
          However, this is an insignficant loss in efficiency that significantly
          increases accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in other ways, my revised component does increase
          accessibility at the expense of efficiency. Adding a "Confirm" button
          means that frequent users have one more click or key to press before
          they can submit their dropdown selection. However, this increases
          accessibility beacuse it means that users with impaired motor control
          are less likely to accidentally submit their selection. This is
          because the extra confirmation transition allows users to accidentally
          select an option, but change their selection without the window
          closing (which is the current behavior of the component when any
          option is clicked).
        </p>
        <h3 id="ref">Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          When thinking about making components more accessible, it's useful to
          think in terms of mismatches, or situations where an interface creates
          unnecessary barriers for certain users due to a lack of inclusive
          thinking. In my redesign, adding keyboard navigability addresses the
          mismatch where users that only use the keyboard can still interact
          with this component. Similarly, adding the "Confirm" button addresses
          the mismatch where some users may accidentally press or interact with
          these components, and the confirmation step is more forgiving of
          accidental clicks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sense, the lack of keyboard accessibility on the Apple
          Calendar and Starbucks dropdowns negatively impacts users with visual
          impairments, since focusing on the dropdown was impossible without
          VoiceOver, which not all impaired users might use. On the other hand,
          the ARIA text read by VoiceOver is a feature that is beneficial to
          those with visual impairments, and across the three applications,
          Starbucks' components had the most clear and descriptive ARIA text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, the mouse is most often prioritized when designing
          components, as many designers are fully-abled. But, this means that
          they may forget to consider the needs of those whose abilities are
          impaired. In this case study, I learned to prioritize the needs of
          users with abilities different from mine, while also prioritizing
          usability.
