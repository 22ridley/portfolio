          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, I’m Sarah! I’m a junior at Brown University studying computer
            science with focuses on systems and design. I'm originally from
            Durham, North Carolina.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe in building systems and interfaces that prioritize the
            needs of users, particularly through accessible features and
            privacy-preserving guardrails.
          </p>

            Outside of classes, I’m part of the

            research privacy and security for LLM/chatbot applications.

          <h3>Professional</h3>
          <p>
            During my summers in college, I have expanded my programming and
            design skills through technical internships. For summer 2025, I will
            be a Software Engineer Intern at Microsoft.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2024, I interned at Audible on a backend services
            team. My internship project focused on upgrading two pipelines to
            CI/CD by building integration test suites.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023, I interned at Pearson on a Site Reliability team, where I
            first encoutered cloud computing and earned my

              >AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification</a

            for Pearson employees.
