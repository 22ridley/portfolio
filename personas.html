        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This case study examines a public interface through the lens of
          accessibility and usability, considering users with different
          experiences, needs, and abilities. The goal is to learn the
          perspectives of these users through interviews and observations, and
          ultimately create personas to understand how this interface does or
          does not meet the needs of these users.
        </p>
        <h3>Sketch</h3>
        <p>
          I chose to examine the laundry machine screen in the dorm buildings at
          Brown University. This screen integrates closely with the washers and
          dryers themselves, but I will focus on the screen. The problem this
          interface is trying to solve is enabling students to do laundry. The
          touch screen, which is physically separate from the washers and
          dryers, is where users select machines and 'pay' (laundry is free for
          Brown students, although they must swipe their ID cards). The users
          press `Start` on the machines themselves after paying on the touch
          screen.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>
          After creating my sketch of ths interace, I then brainstormed the
          questions I needed to ask users to understand how they use the
          interface and whether it meets their needs. Below is the list of
          questions, and if you click on one, you can read about what I hope to
          gain by asking each question.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary>1. What is your class year at Brown?</summary>
          <p>
            This question indirectly gains an understanding of how long the
            interviewee has been using these laundry machines. Asking a student
            "About how many times have you used the laundry machines at Brown?"
            could lead to overestimation, in order to avoid appearing like they
            don't wash their clothes enough.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
            Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This question aims to understand the interviewee's main priority
            while they're washing their clothes, without asking directly what
            they care most about. This question should prompt users to talk
            about whether they're focused on getting their laundry done quickly,
            or thoroughly, or just to getting it done at all.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            3. How would you describe the laundry machine interface to someone
            who has never seen it before?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This question aims to get users thinking broadly about the laundry
            machine interfaces and give a general summary that might reveal
            their perspectives on the features or flaws of the system. This
            question also sets up the next couple of questions by prompting the
            interviewee to step into the mindset of a new user.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            4. Describe your first time using the laundry screen at Brown.
          </summary>
          <p>
            If the interviewee remembers their first experience with the laundry
            interface, they will hopefully recall the challenges faced when
            learning the system. This can reinforce areas of improvement for the
            interface in terms of learnability.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            5. In that first experience using the laundry interface, did it work
            as you expected it to?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This is a follow-up question to 4 that aims to further explore
            whether or not the laundry interface meets new users' expectations.
            This further digs into the question of whether this interface is
            designed to be learnable, and what frustrations might be common in
            the process of using this interface.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
            first semester?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Turning to focus on the interviewee's current use of the interface,
            this question aims to illustrate a user that is more experienced
            with the system and has learned its quirks. This also prompts the
            interviewee to consider how their experience has changed over time,
            and how the memorable and efficient the interface is.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry screen?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Although this question is more direct than former questions, these
            previous questions have put the interviewee in a mindset of
            comparing their past and present experiences with the laundry
            interface. This question therefore aims to specifically understand
            how the laundry interface may still not be meeting the needs of
            experienced users.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            8. What would you change about how this laundry interface works?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Finally, this is an open-ended question that asks broadly about what
            the interviewee might change about the system. This change could
            reveal a feature that could make the interface more learnable,
            memorable, or efficient, or further highlight what flaws currently
            prevent the interface from meeting users' needs.
          </p>
        </details>
        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>
          After preparing my questions, I observed 3 Brown students using this
          laundry interface in the Goddard dormitory. To respect their privacy
          as users, I made sure to receive consent before observing them. When
          interacting with the system, they did not need to input any sensitive
          information, and generally, I believe this system respects user
          privacy. Below is a summary of my observations:

              &emsp;The 3 students that I observed all interacted with the
              laundry machine interface in a similar order of tasks. They each
              poked their head into the laundry room to see if there were
              available machines, loaded their laundry into either washers or
              dryers, added their detergent, and approached the screen interface
              on the wall. The first user I observed loaded clothes into two
              washers, whereas the second used one washer and the third used one
              dryer.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;I noticed the first user taking their time with the
              interaction. They pressed 'tap to get started', then selected the
              first washer they had loaded. The screen changed to display the
              washer's default settings (light soil, normal cycle, cold water).
              The user seemed to want different settings, so they left the
              screen and pressed buttons on the first washer to update the
              settings. They returned to the screen, added their second washer,
              approached their second washer to update the settings, then
              returned to the screen. They finished the interaction slowly but
              without a sense of confusion.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;The second and third users completed their interactions with
              more of a sense of urgency. Neither user changed the default
              settings, and they quickly tapped through the options on the
              screen, seemingly without much consideration.
              <br /><br />
              &emsp;However, the third user was slowed down by swiping their
              Brown card with the wrong orientation the first time they tried.
              They quickly swiped their card again facing the other direction,
              quickly finished the pseudo-payment process, and pressed 'Start'
              on their dryer.
              <br /><br />
              <b>MAIN TAKEAWAYS: </b>
              <br />
              &emsp;The users I observed differed in their senses of urgency
              using the interface, as well as the number of machines used. The
              main struggle I noticed was the third user swiping their card the
              wrong way, which present an accessibility issue.

              <b>1. What is your class year at Brown?</b> <br /><br />&emsp;The
              first and third students I interviewed were juniors, and the
              second student was a sophomore. These students have all used this
              laundry system for at least 3 semesters, and could be considered
              experienced users. <br /><br />
              <b
                >2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
                Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;The first user didn't seem to understand the question, so I
              clarified by asking what their main priority was when using the
              laundry system. They answered that their main focus was checking
              one of the chores off their list of weekend to-dos (I conducted
              these interviews on a Sunday). The third also emphasized getting
              it done and getting their clothes clean for the week. Somewhat
              differently, the second user said their main focus was getting the
              laundry done as quickly as possible, since sometimes when they try
              to do it, there isn't a machine available.<br /><br />
              <b
                >3. How would you describe the laundry interface to someone who
                has never seen it before?</b
              >
              <br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern outlined was the process of
              loading their machines, using the touch screen to select the
              machines, swiping the Brown ID, and pressing `Start`. The third
              user mentioned that you have to swipe your card with the metal
              strip facing left, awknowledging that they mix this up a lot
              (since a lot of the other card readers on campus are oriented the
              opposite direction). The second user mentioned that its useful to
              set an alarm on your phone to know when to pick up your laundry.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >4. Describe your first time using the laundry screen at
                Brown.</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Each of the students had to think to recall their first time
              using the screen to do their laundry. The first user described
              that they didn't remember having any difficulty doing their
              laundry at Brown since they've always done it at home. The second
              user mentioned that they found the interface a little strange the
              first few times they used it, since you need to swipe your Brown
              ID, even though the laundry is free. The third user noted that
              they had to ask another student for help the first time they used
              the screen since they were confused about to select machines.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >5. In that first experience using the laundry screen, did it
                work as you expected it to?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Similar to the previous question, the interviewees didn't
              exactly recall what they had expected the first time they used the
              machines. The second user emphasized that their main expectation
              was to get their clothes clean, and the screen interface enabled
              that for them. Also, the first user noted that the touch screen
              interface resembles and iPad, and it generally works the same as
              an iPad, so their expectations were met.<br /><br />
              <b
                >6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
                first semester?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern in answers was that all 3
              users had gained comfort using the laundry interface and machines
              since their first time using it. The second user mentioned that
              they no longer had to think about what they were doing when using
              the screen interface, and just clicked the same buttons as always.
              The third user also added that the time it took to do their
              laundry was definitely less than the first time they did it.<br /><br />
              <b
                >7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry
                screen?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The first user mentioned that sometimes the
              buttons on the laundry screen were slow to respond to taps, but
              generally they had recently found the process smooth. The third
              user again noted that the direction of the card reader was
              annoying and tricky, but besides that, they hadn't had recent
              issues. The second user did not recall any recent issues.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >8. What would you change about how this laundry interface
                works?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The third user suggested having a clearer label
              indicating which way to swipe your Brown ID on the card reader
              that's part of the interactive screen. The first user couldn't
              think of any suggestions, and the second user proposed more clear
              advice on how to use your phone to complete these interactions
              (the app hasn't been working for them lately). While I think this
              is a good idea, I asked if they had any suggestions for the
              physical interface, and they didn't. <br /><br />

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>
          After recording my observations and conducting my interviews, I
          created two personas that represent patterns I identified in the 3
          users I interviewed. This patterns of behavior and interaction with
          the interface are drawn from both their descriptions of their current
          interactions as well as those when they first used the interface.
          These two personas are represented in the two empathy maps below.

              one week into orientation at Brown and hasn't done their laundry
              yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user's main problem is that they need to figure out how to use
              the screen interface in their process of doing the laundry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user sees the washers, and starts loading their clothes into a
              machine. They add their detergent and try to press the `Start`
              button, but nothing happens. With another student's help, the
              <b>Nervous First-year</b> realizes that they need to use the
              screen. With some difficulty, including swiping their card the
              wrong way and being unsure about settings, they eventually start
              their laundry.
            </p>
            <p>
              This <b>Nervous First-year</b> represents users of the laundry
              interface, because it is common for students to find the interface
              confusing the first time they use it. These students also have
              many other things on their minds while doing their laundry, which
              this empathy map also reflects.

        <p><b>Rushed Upperclassman Persona</b></p>
        <div class="persona">
          <div class="persona2-txt">
            <p>
              This empathy map displays the <b>Rushed Upperclassman</b>, who is
              doing their laundry in between studying for an exam.
            </p>
            <p>
              This user is an upperclassman, and is comfortable with how the
              laundry machine interface works, so their main problem is getting
              their laundry done quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <b>Rushed Upperclassman</b> has tried to do their laundry
              before today, but the washers were all taken, and they're stressed
              because they have class soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user empties someone else's finished washer, loads their
              clothes, and uses the screen to select the washer. They keep the
              default settings and swipe their card the wrong way, even though
              they've done this countless times. They swipe again and retreat to
              get some work done before class.
            </p>
            <p>
              This persona represents the users of this interface because all
              Brown students are in a rush with many things to do. Also, one of
              the interviewees noted that they swipe their card wrong sometimes,
              even as a junior. This represents how experienced users still
              struggle with this interface.

        <h3>Storyboards</h3>
        <p>
          After creating my personas for the Nervous First-year and the Rushed
          Upperclassman, I chose to create a storyboard for the Nervous
          First-year. The storyboard displays this user's entire user journey
          from start to end. As depicted below, the Nervous First-year is doing
          their laundry at college for the first time, and will face several
          challenges interacting with the laundry interface (with a main focus
          on the screen).
        </p>
        <p><b>The User Journey of a Nervous First-year</b></p>
        <img
          src="public/personas/storyboard.svg"
          alt="Storyboard depicting the user journey of a nervous first-year student"
          class="storyboard"
        />
        <p>
          The troubles that this <b>Nervous First-year</b> faced (including not
          knowing how to change the settings, swiping their card the wrong way,
          and not understanding why they need to swipe their card for a free
          service) are not necessarily isolated to new users. Many of the
          required actions are inaccessible to users with limit physical
          mobility, and increases the barrier to use. Beyond accessibility, as
          revealed in my interviews, these are also issues with all three
          components of the usability — learnability, memorability, and
          efficiency — of this screen interface.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          My findings suggest improvements that Brown could make to their
          laundry system to better meet students' needs. For example, the
          university could stop requiring students to swipe their Brown ID,
          given that laundry is free and only Brown students can access the
          laundry rooms. Or, at least add a clearer affordance for which
          direction to swipe the Brown ID. This would save new and returning
          users time and increase the usability of this interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of these points for improvement, this case study was a
          useful exercise in understanding and illustrating users' needs and
          experiences based on my observations. This experience was also a great
          reminder of how important it is to design both physical and digital
          interfaces with accessible features in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you to those students who participated in interviews!</p>
