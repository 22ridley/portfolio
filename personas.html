        <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This case study examines a public interface through the lens of
          <b>accessibility</b> and <b>usability</b>, considering users with
          different experiences, needs, and abilities. The goal is to learn the
          perspectives of these users through interviews and observations, and
          ultimately create personas to understand how this interface does or
          does not meet the needs of these users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="prob">Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The interface I chose to examine is the laundry machine interface in
          the dorm buildings at Brown University. One problem with this
          interface is that it is
          <b>confusing</b>. The process has many steps, some of which feel
          unnecessary, and are easy to do incorrectly. By understanding how
          users currently interact with this system, I can examine pitfalls and
          understand how this interface could be improved.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sketch">Sketch</h3>
        <p>
          The laundry interface consists of a screen, which integrates closely
          with the washers and dryers themselves, but I will focus on the
          screen. The problem this interface is trying to solve is enabling
          students to do laundry. The touch screen, which is physically separate
          from the washers and dryers, is where users select machines and 'pay'
          (laundry is free for Brown students, although they must swipe their ID
          cards).
        </p>

        />
        <h3 id="user">User Research</h3>
        <p>
          After creating my sketch of ths interace, I then brainstormed the
          questions I needed to ask users to understand how they use the
          interface and whether it meets their needs. Below is the list of
          questions, and if you click on one, you can read about what I hope to
          gain by asking each question.
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary>1. What is your class year at Brown?</summary>
          <p>
            This question indirectly gains an understanding of how long the
            interviewee has been using these laundry machines. Asking a student
            "About how many times have you used the laundry machines at Brown?"
            could lead to overestimation, to avoid appearing like they don't
            wash their clothes enough.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
            Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This question aims to understand the interviewee's main priority
            while they're washing their clothes, without asking directly what
            they care most about. This question should prompt users to talk
            about whether they're focused on getting their laundry done quickly,
            or thoroughly, or just to getting it done at all.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            3. How would you describe the laundry machine interface to someone
            who has never seen it before?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This question aims to get users thinking broadly about the laundry
            machine interfaces and give a general summary that might reveal
            their perspectives on the features or flaws of the system. This
            question also sets up the next couple of questions by prompting the
            interviewee to step into the mindset of a new user.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            4. Describe your first time using the laundry screen at Brown.
          </summary>
          <p>
            If the interviewee remembers their first experience with the laundry
            interface, they will hopefully recall the challenges faced when
            learning the system. This can reinforce areas of improvement for the
            interface in terms of learnability.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            5. In that first experience using the laundry interface, did it work
            as you expected it to?
          </summary>
          <p>
            This is a follow-up question to 4 that aims to further explore
            whether or not the laundry interface meets new users' expectations.
            This further digs into the question of whether this interface is
            designed to be learnable, and what frustrations might be common in
            the process of using this interface.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
            first semester?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Turning to focus on the interviewee's current use of the interface,
            this question aims to illustrate a user that is more experienced
            with the system and has learned its quirks. This also prompts the
            interviewee to consider how their experience has changed over time,
            and how the memorable and efficient the interface is.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry screen?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Although this question is more direct than former questions, these
            previous questions have put the interviewee in a mindset of
            comparing their past and present experiences with the laundry
            interface. This question therefore aims to specifically understand
            how the laundry interface may still not be meeting the needs of
            experienced users.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            8. What would you change about how this laundry interface works?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Finally, this is an open-ended question that asks broadly about what
            the interviewee might change about the system. This change could
            reveal a feature that could make the interface more learnable,
            memorable, or efficient, or further highlight what flaws currently
            prevent the interface from meeting users' needs.
          </p>
        </details>
        <h3 id="int">Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          After preparing my questions, I observed 3 Brown students using this
          laundry interface in the Goddard dorm. To respect their
          <b>privacy as users</b>, I received consent before observing them.
          When interacting with the system, they did not need to input any
          sensitive information, so this digital system poses little risk to
          user privacy. However, the physical act of loading a laundry machine
          with clothes is somewhat vulnerable, althuogh I will not focus on
          physical privacy concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I observed, I also asked these users my interview questions, and
          their answers are summarized below:

              <b>1. What is your class year at Brown?</b> <br /><br />&emsp;The
              first and third students I interviewed were juniors, and the
              second student was a sophomore. These students have all used this
              laundry system for at least 3 semesters, and could be considered
              experienced users. <br /><br />
              <b
                >2. Whenever it's time to interact with the laundry interface at
                Brown, what's the main thing on your mind?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;The first user answered that their main focus was checking
              one of the chores off their list of weekend to-dos (I conducted
              these interviews on a Sunday). The third also emphasized getting
              it done and getting their clothes clean for the week. Somewhat
              differently, the second user said their main focus was getting the
              laundry done as quickly as possible, since sometimes when they try
              to do it, there isn't a machine available.<br /><br />
              <b
                >3. How would you describe the laundry interface to someone who
                has never seen it before?</b
              >
              <br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern outlined was the process of
              loading their machines, using the touch screen to select the
              machines, swiping the Brown ID, and pressing `Start`. The third
              user mentioned that you have to swipe your card with the metal
              strip facing left, awknowledging that they mix this up a lot
              (since a lot of the other card readers on campus are oriented the
              opposite direction). <br /><br />
              <b
                >4. Describe your first time using the laundry screen at
                Brown.</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Each of the students had to think to recall their first time
              using the screen to do their laundry. The first user described
              that they didn't remember having any difficulty doing their
              laundry at Brown since they've always done it at home. The second
              user mentioned that they found the interface a little strange the
              first few times they used it, since you need to swipe your Brown
              ID, even though the laundry is free.
              <br /><br />
              <b
                >5. In that first experience using the laundry screen, did it
                work as you expected it to?</b
              ><br /><br />
              &emsp;Similar to the previous question, the interviewees didn't
              exactly recall what they had expected the first time they used the
              machines. The second user emphasized that their main expectation
              was to get their clothes clean, and the screen interface enabled
              that for them.<br /><br />
              <b
                >6. Has your comfort using the laundry screen changed since your
                first semester?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The general pattern in answers was that all 3
              users had gained comfort using the laundry interface and machines
              since their first time using it. The second user mentioned that
              they no longer had to think about what they were doing when using
              the screen interface, and just clicked the same buttons as
              always.<br /><br />
              <b
                >7. Have you recently had any difficulties using the laundry
                screen?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The first user mentioned that sometimes the
              buttons on the laundry screen were slow to respond to taps, but
              generally they had recently found the process smooth. The third
              user again noted that the direction of the card reader was
              annoying and tricky, but besides that, they hadn't had recent
              issues. <br /><br />
              <b
                >8. What would you change about how this laundry interface
                works?</b
              ><br /><br />&emsp;The third user suggested having a clearer label
              indicating which way to swipe your Brown ID on the card reader
              that's part of the interactive screen. The first user couldn't
              think of any suggestions, and the second user proposed more clear
              advice on how to use your phone to complete these interactions
              (the app hasn't been working for them lately). <br /><br />

        <p>
          After recording my observations and conducting my interviews, I
          created two <b>personas</b> that represent patterns I identified in
          the 3 users I interviewed. This patterns of behavior and interaction
          with the interface are drawn from both their descriptions of their
          current interactions as well as those when they first used the
          interface. These two personas are represented in the two
          <b>empathy maps</b>
          below.

                This first persona depicts the <b>Nervous First-year,</b> who is
                one week into orientation at Brown and hasn't done their laundry
                yet.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user's main problem is that they need to figure out how to
                use the screen interface in their process of doing the laundry.
              </li>
              <li>
                The user sees the washers, and starts loading their clothes into
                a machine. They add their detergent and try to press the `Start`
                button, but nothing happens. With another student's help, the
                <b>Nervous First-year</b> realizes that they need to use the
                screen.
              </li>

                With some difficulty, including swiping their card the wrong way

                laundry.
              </li>
              <li>
                This <b>Nervous First-year</b> represents users of the laundry
                interface, because it is common for students to find the
                interface confusing the first time they use it. These students
                always have many other things on their minds while doing their
                laundry.

                The user empties someone else's finished washer, loads their
                clothes, and uses the screen to select the washer. They keep the
                default settings and swipe their card the wrong way, even though
                they've done this countless times. They swipe again and retreat

                Brown students are in a rush with many things to do. Also, even
                experienced users still struggle with this interface.

        <p>
          After creating my personas for the Nervous First-year and the Rushed
          Upperclassman, I chose to create a <b>storyboard</b> for the Nervous
          First-year. The storyboard displays this user's entire user journey
          from start to end. As depicted below, the Nervous First-year is doing
          their laundry at college for the first time, and will face several
          challenges interacting with the laundry interface (with a main focus
          on the screen).

        <p><b>The User Journey of a Nervous First-year</b></p>
        <img

          class="storyboard"
        />
        <p>
          The troubles that this <b>Nervous First-year</b> faced (including not
          knowing how to change the settings, swiping their card the wrong way,
          and not understanding why they need to swipe their card for a free
          service) are not necessarily isolated to new users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the required actions are inaccessible to users with limit
          physical mobility, and increases the barrier to use. Beyond
          <b>accessibility</b>, as revealed in my interviews, these are also
          issues with all three components of the <b>usability</b> —
          learnability, memorability, and efficiency — of this screen interface.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ref">Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          My findings suggest improvements that Brown could make to their
          laundry system to better meet students' needs. For example, the
          university could stop requiring students to swipe their Brown ID,
          given that laundry is free and only Brown students can access the
          laundry rooms. Or, at least add a clearer <b>affordance</b> for which
          direction to swipe the Brown ID. This would save new and returning
          users time and increase the usability of this interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of these points for improvement, this case study was a
          useful exercise in understanding and illustrating users' needs and
          experiences based on my observations. This experience was also a great
          reminder of how important it is to design both physical and digital
          interfaces with <b>accessible</b> features in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Thank you to those students who participated in interviews!</p>
